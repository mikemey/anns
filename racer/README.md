### Train NEAT network

General introduction to NEAT training: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Each generation is trained on all tracks specified by `TRAINING_LEVELS` in [tracks.py](game/tracks.py).
The genome fitness criteria is sum of the distance (**= score**) travelled on all trainings tracks
from start-/finish-line, until:
- player touches track outlines
- distance is negative (ie moves backwards)
- score-points per seconds less than 20
- level-limit is reached (see track definitions in [tracks.py](game/tracks.py))

A training top-list is updated after every generation (see `keep_best_players` configuration). 
If the top-list is updated, a copy is saved in directory `racer/best-players`. 

A fitness summary is logged after each batch (see `showcase_every_gen` + `showcase_racer_count` configuration),
and a showcase with the best genomes/players of the current generation is presented.

#### Configuration

NEAT configuration file: [training.cfg](neural/training.cfg) (see also [NEAT-Python configuration](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html))

Additional to the NEAT-configuration, following parameters required: 

```
[TRAINING]
processes              = 6
keep_best_players      = 10
keep_fitness_threshold = 6000
showcase_every_gen     = 10
showcase_racer_count   = 5
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| **processes** | number of processes used in training/showcasing |
| **keep_best_players** | number of top-players to keep during training |
| **keep_fitness_threshold** | required minimum fitness for keeping players |
| **showcase_every_gen** | batch-size: showcase every n-th generation |
| **showcase_racer_count** | racers in a showcase |


### Start training

### Replay stored players

To run a showcase with players stored in directory `racer/best_players`, start with `play`: 

```bash
[project-root-dir] $ python3 racer play racer/best_players/20200418-165907_best.pd
[2020-04-20 15:26:53] --- START ---
genome file read: racer/best_players/20200418-165907_best.pd
Showcase: 5 players (fit/sps) 4506/49.8, 4505/49.7, 4500/49.2, 4499/49.5, 2268/50.5
Showcases finished, waiting 3 seconds to exit...
```

### Replay top players

**Temporarily not working due to changes in tracing lines (sensors for nn)**

The player-store file [examples/top_players.pd](examples/top_players.pd) contains the top-10 players from all player-store files in [examples/](examples).
A shortcut to run a random selection of these top players it `top`:

```bash
[project-root-dir] $ python3 racer top
```

### Track builder

<p align="center"><img src="docs/track-builder.png" width="700"/></p>

To start building your own track:

```bash
[project-root-dir] $ python3 racer build
```
